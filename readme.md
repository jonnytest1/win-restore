problem:

something broke on your windows install , so you make a backup of ur drive and reinstall windows
not u need to copy over all the programs/program config, windows configuration and customization

solution:

program that scans the source (drive/folder/image file) for stuff to move over

- Programs
- %userprofile%
- registry entires both related to programs like putty sessions and windows configuration like file explorer right click
  - environment variables
- desktop icons
- taskbar icons
- taskbar icon configuration (like which tray icons shouldnt be folded)
